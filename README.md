<h1 align="center">ITSP Lab 4</h1>

#In this project the following python programs have been tested:-

-Class Point

-Class Circle

-Class Rectangle

-Class Shape

#All the functions of the above mentioned classes were tested in detail. Class Shape was the parent class and was tested individually and also along with Point, Circle and Rectangle.

#The individual classes have been uploaded as individual files along with the main test file titled 'Lab4.py'.

#Through the use of inheritence Point, Circle and Rectangle classes have aquired properties of Shape and this has indeed facilitated the reusability of the code and all base classes have their own individual features as well.

#Through the use of unit testing it is ensured that all the codes are running and there is no scope for errors.

#Unit testing has been deployed on all classes and their functions.
